**Known facts and unresolved problems.** Metformin and NAFLD: key facts are established, yet important uncertainties remain. We summarize what is known and clarify the outstanding problem motivating this study.


**Brief subject review with recent citations.** Recent work has advanced the field; representative reports include Younossi 2019; Rinella 2025. We highlight trends and methodological shifts within the last 5â€“10 years.


**Research gap.** Despite progress, a specific gap persists in scope, population, comparator, outcomes, timing, or setting. Precisely defining this gap informs our objectives.


**This study: methods and contents.** Here we outline the approach, datasets/participants, primary endpoints, and planned analyses to address the gap.
